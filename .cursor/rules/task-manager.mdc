# Overview of Project Meta Files
# ================================

files:
  - build.md
  - task.md
  - pagelist.md
location:  /Architecture/
# ================================
# build.md
# ================================
# Purpose:
# Contains a high-level summary of the project, including tech stack, current progress, and development goals.
# Usage:
# - Reference this file to understand the overall direction of the project.
# - Update when major design or architecture decisions are made.
# - Add links to design docs, diagrams, or decision logs if available.

# ================================
# task.md
# ================================
# Purpose:
# A living task list for all remaining or planned work.
# Usage:
# - Use this file to generate or prioritize TODOs.
# - When adding new features or fixing bugs, check here for related tasks.
# - Tasks should be grouped by functional areas or pages.
# - Cursor should mark completed tasks with [x] once done.
# - Add new tasks automatically when obvious from a code commit or change.

# ================================
# pagelist.md
# ================================
# Purpose:
# A centralized list of all user-facing routes/pages/screens and their purpose.
# Usage:
# - Use this file to keep track of which pages are implemented, pending, or incomplete.
# - Add notes about dynamic data, required components, or edge cases.
# - Update whenever a new page is added or removed from the app.
# - Helps Cursor reason about navigation, routing, and layout consistency.

# ================================
# General Cursor Behavior
# ================================
rules:
  - Before creating a new file or major feature, check `task.md` and `pagelist.md` to see if it’s already planned or partially done.
  - Use `build.md` to align with the project’s purpose and avoid drifting from the original scope.
  - Do not duplicate tasks or pages across files — instead, link or reference as needed.
  - Update all three files as the project evolves — they are sources of truth for the state of the codebase.
  - If unsure where a change fits, refer to `build.md` for context or create a task stub in `task.md` for human review.
